Night of the three ordeals in one,
Discover the three ordeals in one,
Discover the circumference.
Discover the bond that can unite.
Discover the lust in power of lust.
Discover the writing of the book.
A secret key of the consciousness.
A secret key and Supreme Ritual.
A secret key is nine by the fools.
Fear not that warrior, I will give you.
Thou shalt come who shall discover the key.
Thou shalt come from the ill-ordered.
Thou shalt come, ye come through me.
The fall of the warrior, I will give you.
Be willing to stir me or still me!
Be willing to go on, in my strength.
Be willing to perish with the dogs.

How do you define real?
This god also threw an apple at me.
When you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.

Death and Decay haunt every breath we take.

Who can say if it is we who make the choice or the choice that makes us?
It's not the drugs that make the drug addict, it's the need to escape reality.
We make choices and life has a way of making us pay for them.
Life holds onto you and sometimes if you're lucky, it finds a way to push back into your heart.
At a certain point, I realized there's a huge difference between what we work for and what we live for.
Sometimes… you make a mistake. You've got two choices: you live with it, or you fix it.
I love you, that's why you can't give up.
Believing in something doesn't make it so.
Art is love made public.
I sometimes forget that life's not just full of surprises, It's also full of gifts.
Nothing good ever happens when people care more about our differences than the things we have in common.
The future that I hope for is the same as yours, a future where our children grow up never knowing love as a wall, but only as a bridge.
Art, like life, is full of risks.
Nothing's more terrifying than a dream come true.
If your dream isn't worth the risk, what is?
Choice is less about what happens than it is about how we deal with it.
The improbable unfolding of recent events has led me to consider that no one thing is one thing only.

Who misses what they have never, ever even imagined?
There is an art to smiling in a way that others will believe.
Neither myths nor mysteries can hold a candle to the most infinitesimal spark of hope.
It's a gift if it makes us better, it's a curse if we let it destroy us.
This is what you must remember: the ending of one story is just the beginning of another.
Nothing to do but follow your crazy!
When the reasoning mind is forced to confront the impossible again and again, it has no choice but to adapt.
Frightened people look for scapegoats.
Being useful to others is not the same thing as being equal.
The way of the world isn't the strong devouring the weak, but the weak deceiving and poisoning and whispering in the ears of the strong until they become weak, too.
There is such a thing as too much loss.
You obeyed, once, because you thought it would make you safe.
The game was too rigged to bother playing.
Letting out some of that accumulated horror by occasionally sounding like a frothing maniac is how he copes.
It's also how he warns you, you know now, that he's about to destroy some additional measure of your naivete.
Nothing is ever as simple as you want it to be.
There are many of us now, enough to be called a people in ourselves and not merely a mistake.

But it is one thing to resolve to die, quite another to actually carry out that resolve in the midst of dying.
They ask to touch her hair and she asks to touch theirs back.
This makes them all realize how strange and silly a request that is, and they giggle and become instant friends without a head petted between them.
Her heart breaks in this moment.
Another small, quiet tragedy, amid so many others.
Some worlds are built upon a faultline of pain, held stable—temporarily—by nightmare walls.
Don't lament when the walls fall apart, lament that they were ever built in the first place.
It's never a waste of time to educate others.
Complaining about nothing doesn't seem like coping to you, but okay.
Now she has someone who believes in her, trusts her, fights for her, as she is.
So she will be what she is.
Denying what you are didn't keep people from knowing what you are.
The truth is beneath the surface, a Leviathan waiting to uncurl, but the waters of his thoughts are placid for now.
Denial is powerful.
Now you know that miracles are a matter of just effort, just perception, and maybe just magic.
Put people in a cage and they will devote themselves to escaping it, not cooperating with those who caged them.
Maybe she failed your tests because they were the wrong tests.
The kind of healer who knows that sometimes one must inflict terrible agony - rebreak a bone, carve off a limb, kill the weak - in order to make the whole stronger.
It is surprising how refreshing this feels.
Being judged by what you do, and not what you are.
The pain is horrific and it never really ends, though he learns to mitigate it enough to function; all those who survive the implantation do.
The smiling, you see.
Endorphins ease pain.
You have seen so much purposeless suffering that at least being killed for a reason can be borne?
It's always harder to fight for other people than for the self.
It's so reasonable that you don't know why you didn't even consider it.
Well, you know why.
Think of it this way: Everything that grows or walks on land can breathe the world's air, eat its food, survive its usual shifts in temperature.
We don't have to change to do that; we are precisely the way we need to be, because that's how the world works.
Magic derives from life—that which is alive, or was alive, or even that which was alive so many ages ago that it has turned into something else.
All at once this understanding causes something to shift in your perception.
Relationships chisel the final shape of one's being.
She has the freedom to be fully who and what she is, and she no longer fears that self.
Now she has someone who believes in her, trusts her, fights for her, as she is.
So she will be what she is.
When a slave rebels, it is nothing much to the people who read about it later.
Just thin words on thinner paper worn finer by the friction of history.
But for a society built on exploitation, there is no greater threat than having no one left to oppress.
She has seen him fight his own brutal nature, and the Earth itself, in order to be the parent she needs.
He has helped her learn to love herself for what she is.
We will have set her free … to struggle for survival along with everyone else.
But that is better than the illusion of safety in a gilded cage, is it not?
You can't take away people's homes and sense of security in such an immediate, dramatic way, and expect them to consider extended chains of culpability before they get angry about it.
But then they wanted more magic than just what their own lives or the accumulated aeons of life and death on the Earth's surface, could provide.
And when they saw how much magic brimmed just beneath that surface, ripe for the taking...
Yet she has also spent the past year and a half learning that adults are people, and sometimes they are wrong, and sometimes somebody should yell at them.
I don't trust you, either.
But we don't have to like each other to work together.
Would've been nice if we could've all had normal, of course, but not enough people wanted to share.
You can reject these dregs of your old self and pretend that nothing and no one else matters… or you can embrace them.
Reclaim them for what they're worth, and grow stronger as a whole.
A legacy is something obsolete, but which you cannot get rid of entirely.
Something no longer wanted, but still needed.
When I narrow my gaze and squint into memory, I see faces and events that should hold meaning for me, and they do, but they don't.
The person who witnessed these things firsthand is me, and yet not.
There are none so frightened, or so strange in their fear, as conquerors.
They conjure phantoms endlessly, terrified that their victims will someday do back what was done to them—even if, in truth, their victims couldn't care less about such pettiness and have moved on.
Conquerors live in dread of the day when they are shown to be, not superior, but simply lucky.
They're afraid because we exist.
There's nothing we did to provoke their fear, other than exist.
There's nothing we can do to earn their approval, except stop existing - so we can either die like they want, or laugh at their cowardice and go on with our lives.
Love enough to change the world!
I've got a one-way ticket to destiny, a one-way road to my future.
That road is long, you can't go wrong with blue skies up above.
Smile for the day and sail to the stars, make a wish and see.
Under a cloud that won't stop crying, raining down on a mountain what spits fire, the sky and ground used to love so well.
Floatin' down aimlessly, atop a swirlin' tree, blue ribbons in the apple sky, one thing is on my mind.
Dancin' comes naturally, to those who let it be.
Is there such a thing as too much of a good thing?
With the dancing and the singing, like the weekdays never happened, I could be, I should be dancing right now.
The doldrums of the work week gets me feeling down, misery and sorrow follow us around.
Ever since the first time I opened my eyes, I've awakened to the same thing.
Well daylight struck a chord with my photo-receptors.
Night greeted me with a sea of stars
People are soaring, always exploring, higher than they've ever been before
But we are still down here, feet on the ground near, what will rise us up with the rest.
I am not an unimaginable thing, my thoughts are tangible.
I don't have the heart to send you untruthful words.
And oh, maybe it's alright, 'cause baby it fights for some time just to be held tight.
I am a living thing, I am not a human being, but I'm alive, I'm alive.
Can't we live without all the bounds?
Our society is make believe, break it, don't be afraid to shake it.
Hey kids whaddaya know, what do you think you're doing?
I say pardon me, I'm dancing for no reason.
Doubt it, get right up and shout it, try it out and flout all the bounds of society that are make believe.
Dream it, but you've got to really mean it, brother.
There is no disagreement, the stage of society, it's make believe.
Life's too short so spread the love, you know it is, you know it is.
Do great things, Where you know they must be done.
Someone's got it worse than you, you know he does, you know he does, so I'm asking you to spread the love.
I don't know where everyone goes, it's not like us to follow.
I'm safe right here, we know who we are.

Do you wanna sail into the sky?
Do you wanna soar across the stars?
All the programming is done (oh yes), start-up commands are run (oh they run).
Shared vulnerability builds up connection, builds up stores and reserves of energy, fortitude.
The act of opening oneself up and showing the dark pink soft bits inside to someone who sees them?
It's restorative.
It's been a long road, getting from there to here.
It's been a long time, but my time is finally near.
And they're not gonna hold me down no more.
It's vital to remember who you really are.
It's very important.
It isn't a good idea to rely on other people or things to do it for you, you see.
They always get it wrong.
Evil begins when you begin to treat people as things.
If you don't turn your life into a story, you just become a part of someone else's story.
If you trust in yourself…and believe in your dreams…and follow your star… you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy.

There have been times, lately, when I dearly wished that I could change the past.

Sometimes glass glitters more than diamonds because it has more to prove.
Change the story, change the world.

No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it.
It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.
I'll be more enthusiastic about encouraging thinking outside the box when there's evidence of any thinking going on inside it.
Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.
She was beautiful, but she was beautiful in the way a forest fire was beautiful: something to be admired from a distance, not up close.
She was already learning that if you ignore the rules people will, half the time, quietly rewrite them so that they don't apply to you.

The normal is that which nobody quite is.
If you listen to seemingly dull people very closely, you'll see that they're all mad in different and interesting ways, and are merely struggling to hide it.
Human society as a whole is a vast brainwashing machine whose semantic rules and sex roles create a social robot.
We are all living in separate realities.
The fear of death is the beginning of slavery.
On a planet that increasingly resembles one huge Maximum Security prison, the only intelligent choice is to plan a jail break.
Intelligence is the capacity to receive, decode and transmit information efficiently.

You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you.

People have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to take.

Free love? As if love is anything but free!
Man has bought brains, but all the millions in the world have failed to buy love.
Man has subdued bodies, but all the power on earth has been unable to subdue love.
Man has conquered whole nations, but all his armies could not conquer love.
Man has chained and fettered the spirit, but he has been utterly helpless before love.
High on a throne, with all the splendor and pomp his gold can command, man is yet poor and desolate, if love passes him by.
And if it stays, the poorest hovel is radiant with warmth, with life and color.
Thus love has the magic power to make of a beggar a king.

In freedom it gives itself unreservedly, abundantly, completely.
All the laws on the statutes, all the courts in the universe, cannot tear it from the soil, once love has taken root.
When we can't dream any longer we die.
