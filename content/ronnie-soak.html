<h3>Agents responsible:</h3>
Agent Trace initially, to whom this spirit manifested
spontaneously. It self described as a <em>'Chaos Angel'</em> which
lead Agent Trace to explore chaos magic and discover KIA.
She says Ronnie seeks contact with the wider magical
community. 
<h3>Nature:</h3>
Angel with deathly white skin, long black hair, black robes
and large black feathered wings. Sometimes wings have
eyes. Has also appeared as a black dragon, a vampire, a man
in black, and a glowing orb (St Elmo's Fire, a willo the wisp,
or ball lightning). Can shape shift.
<h3>Powers:</h3>
Does not seem to want to help everyone, but will sometimes
come to the aid of those in deep depression and teach them the value of life. Unpredictable.
Mysterious. Enigmatic. You may simply call on this entity for no specific purpose other than to
make the connection. What you get out of it may depend on how open you are to learning from the
experience.
<h3>Suggestions:</h3>
Use the sigil or a doll as a focal point. A doll, if constructed, should be mostly black and black
winged, but may have a pale grey/silver/white skin. Incorporate black candles and representations
of death on the altar. Black and peacock feathers may be used.
<h3>Relationships with DKMU Godforms:</h3>
Unknown. Possible similarities with Trigag and 663
if any.
