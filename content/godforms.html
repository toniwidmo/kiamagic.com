    Kia seems to manifest either as an irrepressibly wise child, or as an irrepressibly strong and

    KIA Invisible Agents, increasing synchronicity with them and gaining insights into the mysteries of
    the group. To connect with your inner child. To increase magical power. Transcendence of duality.
