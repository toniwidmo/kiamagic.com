<h2>The KIA Godforms</h2>

<h3>KIA Egregore</h3>

<h4>Sigil</h4>
<p>AOS glyph with added eye. The eye can be as simple as a dot, a vesica pisces, a dot inside a vesica
    pisces, or as elaborate as the magician wishes.</p>

<h4>Special date:
KIA was born 09/02/2001. You can celebrate her birthday any 9th of February. This is also a good
day to make an egregore doll, but you can make one at any time.
<h4>Related archetypes:</h4>
• Crowned and conquering child (Thelemic)
• The androgyne (Hermetic)
• The child Ganesha (Hindu)
• Hybrid baby (UFO lore)
• Changeling (Folklore)
<h4>Pop culture:</h4>
• Little My (The Moomins)
• Pippy Longstocking
• Ronya the robbers daughter
• The child Sophia (VALIS)
• The Star Child (common Sci-Fi motif)
• Kehaar (Watership down)
<h4>Animal:</h4>
The vulture was associated with the concept of Kia by Austin Osman Spare. Other scavenger birds,
including crows, ravens, jackdaws and gulls also seem relevant. Indeed, the gull in Watership
Down, Kehaar, even has a similar sounding name.
<h4>Agents responsible:</h4>
This egregore was initially created by Toni Widmo, Jaq D Hawkins, Angelina Lovecraft,
Confused Monkeyboy and Frater Equilibrium. It might not have been entirely intentional at the
time, but the egregore might be an anthropomorphic manifestation of Austin Osman Spare’s concept
of Kia.
<h4>Nature:</h4>
Kia seems to manifest either as an irrepressibly wise child, or as an irrepressibly strong and
adventurous child. Perhaps both. However scavenger birds often appear as her messengers.
Recently, she has appeared as a teenager, perhaps reflecting her birth date.
<h4>Powers:</h4>
Currently known powers of the egregore include; making and strengthening connections with other
KIA Invisible Agents, increasing synchronicity with them and gaining insights into the mysteries of
the group. To connect with your inner child. To increase magical power. Transcendence of duality.
States of neither-neither. Scavenging. Navigating the air currents and thermals to soar higher.
<h4>Suggestions:</h4>
Make an egregore doll, work with it, and pass it on to another agent for them to work with. Find
another agent with an egregore doll they wish to pass on and volunteer to take and work with it.
Altar could include the colours red, white and black, gold and silver. Use either a doll, the sigil or a
KIA logo image as a focus. Open with a Kia IAO Centring ritual, and invite Kia to manifest.
Incorporatie parts of the KIA litany into the invitation. You could also get a paragraph from the KIA
Speaks tool to meditate upon as a message for the ritual. Explore various methods of
communication with Kia. Dialogue, automatic writing, automatic drawing, divination, scrying, look
for appearances in dreams, or encounters with relevant birds. Ask her to aid with enchantments.
<h4>Relationships with DKMU Godforms:</h4>
At least two of the egregore dolls, including the original, have been marked with the linking sigil,
connecting KIA to the web of Ellis. It should be noted that Pippy is the daughter of a Pirate, and
Ronya the daughter of a robber. This also suggests a father-daughter relationship with Zalty.

<h3>The Chaos Monkey</h3>
Glyph:
Created in the parachute ritual described in the book, and performed at the 2002 KIA meeting at St
Baphomet’s Church of Chaos.
Agents responsible:
Jaq D Hawkins. First explored in her now out of print book, Chaos Monkey. Jaq recommends her
latest book, Chaonomicon, for a more complete exploration of the monkey.
Related archetypes:
• Hanuman (Hindu)
• King monkey (Journey to the West)
• The Ape of Thoth (Egyptian)
• Andras (Goetia)
Pop culture:
• Rafiki (The Lion king).
• King of the Monkeys (The Jungle Book)
• Mr Monkey (Kubo and the two strings).
• The monkey Jack (Pirates of the Caribbean).
• Herr Nilssen (Pippy Longstocking).
• Abu (Aladdin’s monkey).
• The librarian (Diskworld).
• Nkima (Tarzan)
Animal:
Monkeys primarily, but also apes of varying kinds.
Nature:
The Chaos Monkey is an animal personification of the spirit of magic. It is a pirate, a thief, a
mischievous clown and an irrepressible trickster. Sows discord. Turns things upside down.
Powers:
To become one with the trickster. To disturb order. To bring excitement to an otherwise orderly life.
To throw a spanner in the works. To learn a more flexible attitude.
Suggestions:
Monkey, ape and pirate motifs on the altar. Sigil or representation as focal point. Banana’s as
sacrament, and the image or other representation of the golden banana, marked with Kallisti,
referencing the apple of discord, may also be used. Incorporate monkey movements and sounds into
calling. As with Kia, explore various techniques and watch for appearances in dreams.
Relationships with DKMU Godforms:
Both Jaq and the Chaos Monkey have pirate associations. Jack Hawkins was a character in Treasure
Island. Thus it is likely the Chaos Monkey has some form of relationship with Zalty, although it is
unclear what this is at this time. More research is needed. As the “Monk Key”, possible relationship
with Ino, although again that would need exploration.
Warning:
Jaq herself insisted we include a warning that you not to evoke the Chaos Monkey at all unless you
are prepared to have your life turned upside down. Consider yourself fore-warned.
Black Rat
Sigil:
The partial pentagram rat head with the ‘skull and bone’ features. They might just be whiskers...
Related archetypes:
• Yag (Romany)
• Rat King (Folklore)
• RATISTs (#ethersec)
Pop culture:
• Death of rats (Diskworld)
• Rat King (Balad of Halo Jones, Diskworld)
• Firmin (Novel)
• Nicodemus (Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH)
• Ben (Willard)
• Scabbers (Harry Potter)
Agents responsible:
Agent Dana Varahi made initial contact and for a while worked with the spirit privately only with
Agents Anton Channing, M and V. M and V were responsible for introducing the Black Rat to
#ethersec in the School of Galatorg.
Animal form:
A black rat. But also other rodents and rodent like creatures.
Significant date:
Black rat night. 6th December. This was the date 'The Black Rat' was named and recognised as a
spirit whilst drinking their sacrament.
Sacrament:
Black rat. A cocktail of 1 part each of Black Sambuca and Piołunówka, set on fire and topped with 2
parts Ginger Wine. Piołunówka is vodka based wormwood drink.
Nature:
The Black Rat is fire spirit. It acts as a guide in getting out of difficult situations. It knows when to
leave a sinking ship and will take you with it. Contact was first made in Bristol, where we
discovered slaves were kept in caves unloading ships, never seeing the light of day. The Black Rat
seemed to be a spirit that helped some escape, and/or get revenge. The Black Rat dislikes bad
landlords, abusive employers and oppressive laws.
Powers:
To help you out of a tight spot, particularly if you feel trapped or oppressed by your situation. To
help you know when to leave a sinking ship. Survival in tough situations. Hacking connections.
Whistleblowing. Leaking information. The signal can’t be stopped.
Suggestions:
Use the sigil as a focal point, incorporate black candles and representations of black rats on the
altar. Black rat toys are easy to obtain around Halloween, although you can sculpt your own at any
time of year. Rat bones may also be employed. One should maintain a positive relationship with
rats, rodents and the oppressed not to incur the ire of this spirit. As with Kia, explore various
techniques and watch for appearances in dreams.
Relationships with DKMU Godforms:
The Black Rat has pirate associations, both from the skull and bones in their sigil and from cross
work with #ethersec, which also included rat and pirate motifs in its workings. Thus it is likely the
Black Rat has some form of relationship with Zalty, although it is unclear what this is at this time.
The rat may relate to pirate crew rather than the captain. The sigil also has similarities to Stephen
Branch’s form of the Trigag sigil. More research is needed on both.

<h3>Ronnie Soak</h3>
Sigil:
As provided by Agent Trace. Resembles bulls head, or head of other horned or antlered animal.
Related artchetypes:
• Azrael (Angel of death)
• Samael (Gnostic)
• Melek Taus (Yezidi)
• Mothman (Ufology)
• MIBs (Ufology)
• The Great Scree (Folklore)
Pop culture:
• Vampires
• Incubi
• Black dragons
• Ring wraith (Lord of the Rings)
Agents responsible:
Agent Trace initially, to whom this spirit manifested
spontaneously. It self described as a ‘Chaos Angel’ which
lead Agent Trace to explore chaos magic and discover KIA.
She says Ronnie seeks contact with the wider magical
community. 
Nature:
Angel with deathly white skin, long black hair, black robes
and large black feathered wings. Sometimes wings have
eyes. Has also appeared as a black dragon, a vampire, a man
in black, and a glowing orb (St Elmo’s Fire, a willo the wisp,
or ball lightning). Can shape shift.
Powers:
Does not seem to want to help everyone, but will sometimes
come to the aid of those in deep depression and teach them the value of life. Unpredictable.
Mysterious. Enigmatic. You may simply call on this entity for no specific purpose other than to
make the connection. What you get out of it may depend on how open you are to learning from the
experience.
Suggestions:
Use the sigil or a doll as a focal point. A doll, if constructed, should be mostly black and black
winged, but may have a pale grey/silver/white skin. Incorporate black candles and representations
of death on the altar. Black and peacock feathers may be used.
Relationships with DKMU Godforms:
Unknown. Possible similarities with Trigag and 663
if any.

<h3>Jena</h3>
Sigil:
Given to agents Anton and Dana during their DKMU godform cycle in 2017.
Related archetypes:
• Sasquatch/Bigfoot/Yeti (Folklore)
• Trolls (Folklore)
• Giants (Folklore)
• Gaea (Greek)
Pop culture:
• Moomin Mama (The Moomins)
• Xena Warrior Princess
• She-Hulk
Agents responsible:
Anton and Dana were told about Jena during the DKMU godform cycle.
Nature:
Protector and guardian of magical spaces, places, power spots, spirits and people.
Powers:
The GIANTESS TROLL GODDESS. She will protect magical places, spirits and people. She has a
nurturing side, but she will also SMASH when she has to. Call on her when a power spot is
threatened or when yourself, a magical alley or the magical community in general, is under threat.
Suggestions:
Use the sigil as a focal point. Incorporate green and blue candles and representations of nature on
the altar. A sacrament of walnut liqueur and soy milk has proved effective. Other milks, such as
almond milk, coconut, goat or cow may be tried as alternatives. As may other kinds of nut liqueur.
Relationships with DKMU Godforms:
Quite different from any current DKMU godforms. In current climate has an alliance with White
Queen with regards environment, but also remembers a time when the ice extended so far it
threatened all life.
