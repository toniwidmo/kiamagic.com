<h3>Agents responsible:</h3>
Toni and Dana were told about Jena during the DKMU godform cycle.
<h3>Nature:</h3>
Protector and guardian of magical spaces, places, power spots, spirits and people.
<h3>Powers:</h3>
The <b>GIANTESS TROLL GODDESS</b>. She will protect magical places, spirits and people. She has a
nurturing side, but she will also SMASH when she has to. Call on her when a power spot is
threatened or when yourself, a magical alley or the magical community in general, is under threat.
<h3>Suggestions:</h3>
Use the sigil as a focal point. Incorporate green and blue candles and representations of nature on
the altar. A sacrament of walnut liqueur and soy milk has proved effective. Other milks, such as
almond milk, coconut, goat or cow may be tried as alternatives. As may other kinds of nut liqueur.
<h3>Relationships with DKMU Godforms:</h3>
Quite different from any current DKMU godforms. In current climate has an alliance with White
Queen with regards environment, but also remembers a time when the ice extended so far it
threatened all life.
