<h2>The KIA Rituals</h2>

<p>A new agent should begin with daily meditation practise and learning a good 'centering' ritual.
    The following Kia IAO Centring ritual is simple to learn and quick to perform. Some agents prefer
    more complex rituals like the calling of quarters and other banishing rituals found in ceremonial 
    magick, the Golden Dawn, Thelema, Chaos Magic and Wicca. The choice is yours.
</p>

<h3>The Kia IAO Centring ritual.</h3>

<p>1. Stand with one arm pointing up, and one arm pointing down, like Baphomet in the famous
    illustration by Eliphas Levi. Visualise the sigil of the KIA Egregore over your heart and
    chant/vibrate 'Kia', 'Keeeeeeeeey Aaaaaaaah'. Start high and lower pitch as you go.</p>

<p>2. Raise both hands above your head, visualise a vertical axis of light passing through your heart,
    connecting you to the heavens and the underworld, and chant/vibrate the letter I,
    'Ieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee'. High pitch.</p>    

<p>3. Lower your hands until they are stretched outwards forming a cross. Visualise a horizontal axis of
    light stretching left and right from your heart, forming a cross with the vertical axis, the Kia sigil in
    the center. Chant/vibrate the letter A, 'Aaarrrhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh'. Medium pitch.</p>    
 
<p>4. Lower your hands again, curling your arms until they form a letter O, your hands overlapping
    around the Dantien or second chakra (a little below your belly button). Visualise an egg around you,
    and around the egg an Ouroborus serpent intersecting the cross. Chant/vibrate the letter O,
    'Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh'. Low pitch.</p>    

<p>You can use this centring ritual to Open a rite and to Close it. You can also use it to 'centre' yourself
    when you need it, when your are feeling anxious, or you need to calm down.
</p>    


<p>These following rituals are a fairly advanced form of magical practise. It is suggested that a new
    agent begin with daily meditation practice for several months. Some experience with sigil
    magic and performing centering rituals is also recommended before moving on to evocation and 
    invocation. 
</p>

<h3>Evocation</h3>

<p>The confident agent should progress to summoning the KIA godforms using a technique of ritual
    magic known as 'evocation'. This is basically a magical attempt to communicate with an entity,
    in this case the godforms and egregores of group.
</p>

<p>You may adapt this material to whatever your preferred methods of evocation may be. If you are
    new to evocation, we suggest using the altar as a centre of manifestation and the centring ritual to
    create a protective aura about yourself. The protection is not because we expect the entities to be
    hostile, but rather to help maintain the separation that distinguishes evocation from invocation. We
    advise building a relationship with the entities through evocation before attempting invocation.</p>

<p>Sit before the altar, call upon the godform, perhaps with a poem or litany in their honour, meditate
    with your gaze upon their sigil (or other representation), until you enter a trance and sense, visualise
    and/or hear their presence. Ideally you should be able to hold a conversation. If you are new to
    evocation you may need multiple attempts. Either way, you may use divination tools and methods,
    such as tarot, as an aid to communication.</p>

<p>Whether or not you succeed, end the ritual with a banishing to mark the transition back to your
    normal reality. Watch for signs in dreams and synchronicities. Record everything in your journal.</p>

<h3>Invocation</h3>
<p>When you feel ready, attempt degrees of invocation. Begin with light invocation methods such as
    allowing the spirit to write an 'automatic writing' through you, or draw an 'automatic drawing'.
    Build up to allowing them to speak through you, act through you. Let them teach you new ways of
    behaving that might prove useful to you in life outside of ritual.</p>
