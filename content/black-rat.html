    <h3>Agents responsible:</h3>
    Agent Dana Varahi made initial contact and for a while worked with the spirit privately only with
    Agents Anton Channing, M and V. M and V were responsible for introducing the Black Rat to
    #ethersec in the School of Galatorg.
    <h3>Animal form:</h3>
    A black rat. But also other rodents and rodent like creatures.
    <h3>Significant date:</h3>
    Black rat night. 6th December. This was the date 'The Black Rat' was named and recognised as a
    spirit whilst drinking their sacrament.
    <h3>Sacrament:</h3>
    Black rat. A cocktail of 1 part each of Black Sambuca and Piołunówka, set on fire and topped with 2
    parts Ginger Wine. Piołunówka is vodka based wormwood drink.
    <h3>Nature:</h3>
    The Black Rat is fire spirit. It acts as a guide in getting out of difficult situations. It knows when to
    leave a sinking ship and will take you with it. Contact was first made in Bristol, where we
    discovered slaves were kept in caves unloading ships, never seeing the light of day. The Black Rat
    seemed to be a spirit that helped some escape, and/or get revenge. The Black Rat dislikes bad
    landlords, abusive employers and oppressive laws.
    <h3>Powers:</h3>
    To help you out of a tight spot, particularly if you feel trapped or oppressed by your situation. To
    help you know when to leave a sinking ship. Survival in tough situations. Hacking connections.
    Whistleblowing. Leaking information. The signal can't be stopped.
    <h3>Suggestions:</h3>
    Use the sigil as a focal point, incorporate black candles and representations of black rats on the
    altar. Black rat toys are easy to obtain around Halloween, although you can sculpt your own at any
    time of year. Rat bones may also be employed. One should maintain a positive relationship with
    rats, rodents and the oppressed not to incur the ire of this spirit. As with Kia, explore various
    techniques and watch for appearances in dreams.
    <h3>Relationships with DKMU Godforms:</h3>
    The Black Rat has pirate associations, both from the skull and bones in their sigil and from cross
    work with #ethersec, which also included rat and pirate motifs in its workings. Thus it is likely the
    Black Rat has some form of relationship with Zalty, although it is unclear what this is at this time.
    The rat may relate to pirate crew rather than the captain. The sigil also has similarities to Stephen
    Branch's form of the Trigag sigil. More research is needed on both.
