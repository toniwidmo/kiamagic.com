<h2>The KIA Egregore</h3>

<h3>Sigil</h3>
<p>AOS glyph with added eye. The eye can be as simple as a dot, a vesica pisces, a dot inside a vesica
    pisces, or as elaborate as the magician wishes.</p>

<h3>Special date:
KIA was born 09/02/2001. You can celebrate her birthday any 9th of February. This is also a good
day to make an egregore doll, but you can make one at any time.

<h3>Animal:</h3>
The vulture was associated with the concept of Kia by Austin Osman Spare. Other scavenger birds,
including crows, ravens, jackdaws and gulls also seem relevant. Indeed, the gull in Watership
Down, Kehaar, even has a similar sounding name.
<h3>Agents responsible:</h3>
This egregore was initially created by Toni Widmo, Jaq D Hawkins, Angelina Lovecraft,
Confused Monkeyboy and Frater Equilibrium. It might not have been entirely intentional at the
time, but the egregore might be an anthropomorphic manifestation of Austin Osman Spare's concept
of Kia.
<h3>Nature:</h3>
Kia seems to manifest either as an irrepressibly wise child, or as an irrepressibly strong and
adventurous child. Perhaps both. However scavenger birds often appear as her messengers.
Recently, she has appeared as a teenager, perhaps reflecting her birth date.
<h3>Powers:</h3>
Currently known powers of the egregore include; making and strengthening connections with other
KIA Invisible Agents, increasing synchronicity with them and gaining insights into the mysteries of
the group. To connect with your inner child. To increase magical power. Transcendence of duality.
States of neither-neither. Scavenging. Navigating the air currents and thermals to soar higher.
<h3>Suggestions:</h3>
Make an egregore doll, work with it, and pass it on to another agent for them to work with. Find
another agent with an egregore doll they wish to pass on and volunteer to take and work with it.
Altar could include the colours red, white and black, gold and silver. Use either a doll, the sigil or a
KIA logo image as a focus. Open with a Kia IAO Centring ritual, and invite Kia to manifest.
Incorporatie parts of the KIA litany into the invitation. You could also get a paragraph from the KIA
Speaks tool to meditate upon as a message for the ritual. Explore various methods of
communication with Kia. Dialogue, automatic writing, automatic drawing, divination, scrying, look
for appearances in dreams, or encounters with relevant birds. Ask her to aid with enchantments.
<h3>Relationships with DKMU Godforms:</h3>
At least two of the egregore dolls, including the original, have been marked with the linking sigil,
connecting KIA to the web of Ellis. It should be noted that Pippy is the daughter of a Pirate, and
Ronya the daughter of a robber. This also suggests a father-daughter relationship with Zalty.
