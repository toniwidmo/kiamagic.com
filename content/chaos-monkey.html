<h3>Animal:</h3>
Monkeys primarily, but also apes of varying kinds.
<h3>Nature:</h3>
The Chaos Monkey is an animal personification of the spirit of magic. It is a pirate, a thief, a
mischievous clown and an irrepressible trickster. Sows discord. Turns things upside down.
<h3>Powers:</h3>
To become one with the trickster. To disturb order. To bring excitement to an otherwise orderly life.
To throw a spanner in the works. To learn a more flexible attitude.
<h3>Suggestions:</h3>
Monkey, ape and pirate motifs on the altar. Sigil or representation as focal point. Banana's as
sacrament, and the image or other representation of the golden banana, marked with Kallisti,
referencing the apple of discord, may also be used. Incorporate monkey movements and sounds into
calling. As with Kia, explore various techniques and watch for appearances in dreams.
<h3>Relationships with DKMU Godforms:</h3>
Both Jaq and the Chaos Monkey have pirate associations. Jack Hawkins was a character in Treasure
Island. Thus it is likely the Chaos Monkey has some form of relationship with Zalty, although it is
unclear what this is at this time. More research is needed. As the “Monk Key”, possible relationship
with Ino, although again that would need exploration.
<h3>Warning:</h3>
Jaq herself insisted we include a warning that you not to evoke the Chaos Monkey at all unless you
are prepared to have your life turned upside down. Consider yourself fore-warned.
