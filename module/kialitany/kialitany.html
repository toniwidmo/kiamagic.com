        <h3>Contacting the KIA Egregore with Ouija board!</h3>
        <h4>An account by Toni Widmo</h4>
        <p>It was the October full moon as we opened the 2013 KIA retreat, and it seemed like a good night to
            talk to the KIA Egregore. In the past we've done this via a computer program that randomly
            combines sentences provided by various KIA agents. But that program is currently broken, and
            besides, this time we decided to opt for something a bit more Victoriana: an English Qabalah ouija
            board.</p>
        <p>After opening the rite with a KIA IAO Centring ritual, we sat around the board and began our first
            experiments with the board. The atmosphere was relaxed and at first we had to try out a few
            different items as a planchette, ultimately settling upon an upturned glass tealight holder.
            Even then it seemed reluctant to move from "Hello", once it had moved there, so we stopped for a
            break and practised some glossolalia to shift conscious awareness away from the rational part our
            minds.</p>
        <p>What follows is an account of the conversation with the spirit that followed. In italics are the
            questions we spoke aloud to the spirit, in bold are its messages to us. Some of these messages need
            to be deciphered using English Qabalah. We will make a post about those later. The board has
            spaces for Hello, Bye, Yes and No, in addition to the letters of the English alphabet.</p>
        
        <pre>
            
        <em>Hello KIA.</em>
        <strong>Hello.</strong>

        <em>Q1. Do you have any questions for us?</em>
        <strong>1</strong>
        <em>What is it?</em>
        <strong>WVQZ</strong>
        <em>Is this for the cipher?</em>
        (pause)
        <strong>L</strong>
        <em>Do you want us to work this out later on?</em>
        <strong>R</strong>
        <strong>No</strong>
        At this point the planchette became unresponsive. We decided to move the next prepared question
        and rotate the scribe.

        <em>Q2 What is the message of KIA?</em>
        <strong>NZ0</strong>
        <em>Nothing?</em>
        <strong>VONCHRHPLPNJGTSNOX</strong>
        <em>KIA, are you having a laugh with us?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Do you want us to move on to the next question?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        Again we changed scribe as we moved on to the next question. We did this between each numbered
        question.

        <em>Q3. Where should we go from here?</em>
        <strong>TIWCZ</strong>
        <em>Is the TIW part a reference to the Norse god?</em>
        The planchette was stuck again, we moved it back to the centre.
        <strong>Z (pause) RVR</strong>
        <em>Do you want to move to the next question?</em>
        <strong>No.</strong>
        <em>Do you want to finish?</em>
        <strong>A</strong>
        <em>Tyrannosaurus?</em>
        <strong>CP4</strong>
        <em>That sounds interesting!</em>
        <strong>No.</strong>
        <em>Maybe we should move to the next question?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>

        <em>Q4. Are you happy with the direction we are going in?</em>
        Planchette moved near the Yes.
        It's not quite on it.
        <strong>Yes.</strong>(suddenly moved onto it more clearly.)
        <strong>SEVAVTI</strong>
        <em>Save something?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <strong>HES</strong>
        <em>He's?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <strong>ON</strong> (pause) <strong>U</strong>
        <em>He's on you?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <strong>HAND</strong>
        <em>He's on your hand?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Who are you?</em>
        <strong>NAYX</strong>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <strong>OLD</strong>
        <em>Old One?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Nyarlathotep?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <strong>F</strong> (pause) <strong>OAKYPLPL</strong>
        <em>People?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Polish People?</em>
        <strong>6</strong>
        Planchette stops moving again.
        <em>Do you have anything more to say?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong> But planchette doesn't move again.
        <em>Shall we move onto next question?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>

        <em>Q5. Do you want something to drink?</em>
        <strong>No.</strong>
        <em>Should we have asked that at the start?</em>
        <strong>0 VASIWCXL</strong>
        <strong>No.</strong>
        <em>Should we ask next question?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>

        <em></em>Q6. What is your time cycle?
        <strong>92c1K</strong>
        <em>K = 1000?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Did K come after C?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Is it 1192? (92 + C + 1K)</em>
        <strong>No.</strong>
        <em>Is it 1209? (9+2c+1K)</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Years?</em>
        <strong>Yes.</strong>
        <em>Is it Solar years?</em>
        <strong>No.</strong>
        <em>Is it years of some other star system?</em>

        <h3>Deciphering the KIA Egregore Ouija messages</h3>
        <h4>An account by Dana Widmo</h4>
        <p>On Friday the 18th of October 2013, five KIA Agents assembled together to contact the KIA
            Egregore using Ouija board with English Qabala Cypher written across it. Last Friday myself and
            Anton finished interpreting/decoding the first two answers. The process was a lengthy one but from
            the start the results obtained captured our imagination and motivated us to carry on. I decoded large
            part of this when Anton was at work but a lot of it was done by both of us.</p>

        <p>First thing we did was to feed the letter sequences given to us during the ouija play into enigmagick
        program which gave us the triangle of numbers. Then we looked up corresponding phrases in Liber
        Al and try constructing meaningful answers from it. This turned out fairly easy with the first
        question. Below you can see the exact results obtained.</p>

        <h4>Q1. Do you have any questions for us?</h4>
<pre><strong>WVQZ LR</strong>
<strong>40 14</strong>
<strong>54</strong></pre>

        <p>First Veil: 54: who cry?</p>
        <p>Second Veil: 40 14 cry who?</p>

        <p>We selected phrases that are meaningful answers, of which we felt "who cry?" was the only one in
            the First Veil. Of the possible results this was the only one that took the form of a question. Then we
            did the same for the Second Veil. The list of results is given below so you can understand the
            process.</p>

        <p>40: shed, ye, have, sake, woes, is so, by all, gross, hair, hour, as she, at an, also of, or on, a joy a,
            cry, of all Ah! Ah!, MOR, hardly, as a sword, altar, host</p>
        <p>14: shall, who, how</p>
        <p>54: who cry?</p>

        <p>We chose words and phrases for 40 followed by 14 assuming that this is the order given to us by
            KIA Egregore. We then looked if any of the combinations make sense to us. We achieved a repeated
            result of inverted structure to the Fist Veil result. Cry Who? To double check our result you can type
            the numbers or letter sequences to enigmagick, or other tool for calculating English Qaballah.</p>

        <p>In the ouija board rite this letter sequence was directly followed by planchette moving onto 'NO'.
        Our interpretation of this message is that KIA Egregore asks 'who is asking?' and says they have no
        further questions. This result is amusing and striking in that we forgot to introduce ourselves to KIA
        when saying hello.</p>

        <p>We used the exact the same method to decode the second question. It was a more complex process
            as the letter sequence was in 3 parts resulting in Three Veils instead of Two.</p>

        <h4>Q2. What is the message of KIA?</h4>
<pre><strong>NZ VONCHRHPLPN JGTSNOX</strong>
<strong>22 132 99</strong>
<strong>154 231</strong>
<strong>253</strong></pre>

        <p>The interpretation of these produced a poetic text we intuitively arranged to form the KIA Litany.</p>

        <h3>Further deciphering to do...</h3>
        <h4>An additional note by Toni Widmo</h4>

        <p>It should be noted that some of the answers to questions 3 through 6 were also ciphers, but 
            these remain undeciphered so far.
