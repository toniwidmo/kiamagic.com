My secret centre,
Cube in the circle.
I have made a secret door
The manifestation.
Thy will, do that and no other.
Come in our splendour.
Thrill with the working!
If thou love, exceed!
Another woman shall awake skies;
Our chosen: who shall rejoice,
They shall surpass the stars.

These words are of the consciousness.
These words are writing of the book.
These words are from the ill-ordered.
These words are filthy, shall be filthy.
These words are splendour in my name.
Midnight is splendour in my name.
Midnight is three ordeals in one.
Midnight is my eyes my spangles.
Midnight is, yet all is ever as it was.
Midnight is the bond that can unite.
Holy place shall be the bond that can unite.
Holy place shall be the ill-ordered house.
Midnight is the double-wanded one.
The double wand I invoke, I greet.
The double wand of the consciousness.
The double wand and Supreme Ritual.
The double wand is nine by the fools.
The double wand stir me or still me!
Fresh fever stir me or still me!
Fresh fever I invoke, I greet.
Fresh fever of the consciousness.
Fresh fever in it thy secret.
Fresh fever none shall stand before
Fresh fever shall be the strength.
Fresh fever go on, in my strength
Fresh fever, a feast for Tahuti and Law.
Our law and the joy I invoke, I greet.
Our law and the joy of the consciousness.
Our law and the joy called the word of Heru-ra-ha.
Our law and the joy shall be the strength.
Our law and the joy none shall stand before
Our law and the joy and I The inspired.
My image in the word of whole of the Law.
My image in the joys of my love will.
My image in the ill-ordered house
My image in the double-wanded one
My image in the child of thy bowels.
My image in three ordeals in one.
My image in splendour rapture!
Fools despise splendour in my name.
Fools despise my eyes my spangles.
Fools despise the joys of my love will.
Fools despise the double-wanded one.
Fools despise the ill-ordered house.
Fools despise pity and compassion.
Fools despise these virtuous words.
Another place of men. Curse them!
Another place none shall stand before.
Fear not that bond that can unite
Fear not that it is all a lie, this folly
Fear not that splendour rapture!
Fear not that lust in power of lust
The lust shall awake the joys of my love will.
The lust shall awake the double-wanded one.
The lust shall awake the child of thy bowels.
The lust shall awake the ill-ordered house.
Look forth upon the ill-ordered house
Look forth upon The child of thy bowels
Look forth upon the double-wanded one
Look forth upon the word of whole of the Law.
Look forth upon my eyes my spangles
Another skies none shall stand before
Night of the three ordeals in one,
Discover the three ordeals in one,
Discover the circumference
Discover the bond that can unite
Discover the splendour rapture!
Discover the lust in power of lust
Discover the writing of the Book
A secret key these virtuous words:
A secret key shall be the strength
A secret key of the consciousness
A secret key and Supreme Ritual,
A secret key is nine by the fools;
A secret key called the word of Heru-ra-ha
Fear not that warrior, I will give you
Thou shalt come who shall discover the key
Thou shalt come from the ill-ordered
Thou shalt come who are also of my friends
Thou shalt come, ye come through me
The fall of the warrior, I will give you
Be willing to stir me or still me!
Be willing to go on, in my strength
Be willing to perish with the dogs
Be willing to convert not: talk not

Us, my servants. Children.
Us, my servants in an egg.
Us, my servants of fire.
Us. My servants forge gold.
Us. My servants live long.
Us. My servants will give.
